Calender Ma is a webapp that is made for students that allows them to drop in their syllabus and the important dates and events get extracted and sent to the calendar of their choice. It is limited to Google Calendar for now. This was crafted in flutter, Flask for the server-side, and includes various API integrations like google calender API and OpenAI APIs. 

Hereâ€™s the link to a video demonstrating the app in action: https://youtu.be/TGeHnCgykRQ
